### The Simple Transformer

Welcome to The Simple Transformer repository! This project aims to provide a beginner-friendly implementation of the Transformer architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks using PyTorch.

## Introduction
The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of natural language processing and other sequence-related tasks. However, the intricacies of the Transformer can be daunting for newcomers. The Simple Transformer seeks to simplify the learning process by providing a clear and approachable implementation that covers key concepts.

This repository includes modular components such as attention mechanisms, encoders, and decoders, along with explanations and examples to aid understanding. Whether you're new to Transformers or looking for a clear implementation to build upon, this project is here to help!

## Features
Beginner-Friendly: Clear and concise implementation with detailed explanations.
Modular: Modular code structure for easy comprehension and extensibility.
Attention Mechanisms: Implementation of self-attention and cross-attention with masking.
Encoders and Decoders: Build your own encoder and decoder components.
Sample Tasks: Examples of tasks like language translation using the implemented architecture.
